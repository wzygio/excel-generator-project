# Issue tracker: Local Markdown

Issues and PRDs for this repository live as Markdown files in `.scratch/`.

## Conventions

- One feature per directory: `.scratch/<feature-slug>/`.
- The PRD is `.scratch/<feature-slug>/PRD.md`.
- Implementation issues are `.scratch/<feature-slug>/issues/<NN>-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01`.
- Record the triage state as a `Status:` line near the top of each issue file; see `triage-labels.md` for the canonical strings.
- Append comments and conversation history under a `## Comments` heading.

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create a new Markdown file under `.scratch/<feature-slug>/`, creating the directory when needed.

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Read the file at the referenced path. The user will normally provide the path or issue number directly.
